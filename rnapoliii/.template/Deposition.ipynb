    "PDB-Dev is a database run by the wwPDB. It is specifically for the deposition of *integrative* models, i.e. models generated using more than one source of experimental data. (Models that use only one experiment generally go in PDB; models that use no experimental information - theoretical models - go in [ModelArchive](https://www.modelarchive.org/))."

    "## Why mmCIF?\n",
    "\n",
    "wwPDB already uses the mmCIF file format for X-ray structures, and has a formal data model ([PDBx](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/)) to describe these structures. The format is *extensible*; extension dictionaries exist to describe NMR, SAS, EM data, etc. For integrative models, we use PDBx plus an \"integrative/hybrid methods\" (IHM) [extension dictionary](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/dictionaries/mmcif_ihm.dic/Index/). This supports coarse-grained structures, multiple input experimental data sources, multiple states, multiple scales, and ensembles related by time or other order."

    "## Why can't we convert PDB/RMF directly to mmCIF?\n",
    "\n",
    "This generally isn't possible because PDB, RMF and ``IMP::Model`` are designed to store one or more output models, where each model is a set of coordinates for a single conformation of the system being studied. A deposition, on the other hand, aims to cover a complete **modeling study**, and should capture not just the entire ensemble of output models, but also all of the input data needed to reproduce the modeling, and quality metrics such as the precision of the ensemble and the degree to which it fits the output data. A deposition is also designed to be visualized, and so may contain additional data not used in the modeling itself, such as preset colors or views to match figures in the publication or highlight regions of interest, and more human-descriptive names for parts of the system. Thus, deposition is largely a data-gathering exercise, and benefits from a modeling study being tidy and well organized (for example, by storing it in a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository) so that data is easy to find and track to its source."

    "## Generation of mmCIF files\n",
    "\n",
    "mmCIF is a text format with a well-defined syntax, so in principle files could be generated by hand or with simple scripts. However, it is generally easier to use the existing [python-ihm library](https://github.com/ihmwg/python-ihm). This stores the same data as in an mmCIF file, but represents it as a set of Python classes, so it is easier to manipulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For deposition, we could use the python-ihm library directly, by writing a Python script that reads in output models and input data, adds annotations, and writes out an mmCIF file. However, since in this case we used ``IMP.pmi`` to do the modeling, we can make use of a class in PMI called [ProtocolOutput](@ref IMP.pmi.mmcif.ProtocolOutput) that automatically captures an entire ``IMP.pmi`` modeling protocol."

    "\n",
    "``~IMP.pmi.mmcif.ProtocolOutput`` is designed to be attached to a top-level PMI object (usually ``IMP.pmi.topology.System``). Then, as the script is run, it will capture all of the information IMP knows about the modeling study, in an ``ihm.System`` object. Additional information not in the modeling script itself, such as the resulting publication, can then be added using the [python-ihm API](https://python-ihm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Database identifiers are preferable because the databases are curated by domain experts and include domain-specific information, and the files are in standard formats. ProtocolOutput will attempt to use these where possible. For example, in this case ProtocolOutput is able to read (using the [ihm.metadata module](@ref ihm.metadata)) the annotations of the input crystal structure used for the modeling (see below) and determine that it is stored in the PDB, so the relevant 1WCM identitifer is included in the mmCIF file (see the `_ihm_dataset_related_db_reference` table). (Similarly, the EMDB EMD-1883 identifier is used for the EM density map.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is used for the modeling which cannot be tracked back to a database, ProtocolOutput will include its path (relative to that of the mmCIF file). For example, in this case the cross-links used are stored in simple CSV files. In addition, the Python script itself is linked from the mmCIF file. Such local paths won't be available to end users, so for deposition we need to replace these paths with database IDs or DOIs (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a further example of linkage, see the links in the previously-published [modeling of the Nup84 complex](https://salilab.org/nup84/) below. The mmCIF file links to the data directly used in the modeling (cross-links, crystal structures, electron microscopy class averages, comparative models, and Python scripts) via database IDs or DOIs. Furthermore, where available links are provided from this often-processed data back to the original data, such as templates for comparative models, mass spectometry spectra for cross-links, or micrographs for class averages:\n",

Thus, it is important for deposition that all input files are annotated as well as possible:\n",

    " - for manually generated PDB files, such as those extracted from a published work or generated by docking or other means, add suitable `EXPDTA` and `TITLE` records to the files for ProtocolOutput to pick up. See the [python-ihm docs](@ref ihm.metadata.PDBParser.parse_file) for more information.\n",
